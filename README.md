# Flask monitoring

This repo is a place for me to play around with using various
monitoring applications (prometheus, grafana, etc) for a very simple
flask app (hello world). 

Everything is running in its own Docker container communicating via
docker networks. Containers and networks are built and setup using
Terraform.
